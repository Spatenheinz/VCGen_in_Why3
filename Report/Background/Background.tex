\section{Background}
When writing a verified VC generator, we must consider both the language that we want to interpret, the syntax and semantics, both operational and axiomatic, of the object language, and the language that we use for writing the VC generator in.

Firstly, we consider an object language \textbf{WHILE} which will be the input for the compiler.
In \autoref{sec:while} we describe the syntax and semantics of the object language.

Secondly, we consider the axiomatic semantics of the language, which we use for generating verification conditions for a given program. This is presented in \autoref{sec:hoare\&wp}, where we describe the Hoare logic and weakest precondiion calculus that we build VC generation on.

Thirdly, we consider the host language used for writing the compiler.
We use Why3 and Isabelle as our two host languages. A brief introduction to both is given in \autoref{sec:why3} and \autoref{sec:isabelle} respectively.

\subsection{WHILE}\label{sec:while}
In this project we work with a simple WHILE language, which is designed to be a minimal but still expressive language.
In \autoref{sec:syntax} we define the syntax of the language, and in \autoref{sec:semantics} the operational semantics.
