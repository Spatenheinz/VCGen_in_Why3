\section{Background}
When writing compilers we must consider atleast two types of languages.
Firstly, we must have a host language used for writing the compiler,
We use Why3 and Isabelle as our two host languages. A brief introduction to both is given in \autoref{sec:why3} and \autoref{sec:isabelle} respectively.
Secondly, we must consider an object language which will be the input for the compiler.
In \autoref{sec:theory} we describe any necessary information about the object language.

\subsection{Theory}\label{sec:theory}
This section will present the necessary theory for the object language.
Specifically, \autoref{sec:while} will describe the syntax and semantics of the object language.
\autoref{sec:hoare} will give a brief overview of Hoare logic,
which is the basis for the Verification condition generation we use, which we describe in detail in
\autoref{sec:wp}.

\subsubsection{WHILE}\label{sec:while}
\input{Background/grammar}
\begin{itemize}
\item We want to define imp
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hoare logic}\label{sec:hoare}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Give a brief introduction to Hoare logic
\item mention soundness etc. We do not prove this.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Weakest Precondition Calculus}\label{sec:wp}
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduce the rules of WP.
\item mention soundness etc. Refer to automated proofs in section ??
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools}

\subsubsection{SMT solvers and ATP}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Brief overview of what SMT solver and ATP are
  \item Listing the different tools we specifically have used.
  \item expressiveness and effectiveness
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Why3}\label{sec:why3}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Brief overview of syntax and usecases
  \item expressive power (coupled with backend)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Isabelle/HOL}\label{sec:isabelle}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Brief overview of syntax and usecases
  \item expressive power (coupled with backend)
\end{itemize}
