\section{Implementation}
In this section we go through the different components of the implementation and compare the Why3 and Isabelle
implementation side by side.
For each component we define a set of predicates which must hold for a correct implementation.
We furthermore make an overall assessment of the qualities of the two languages gradually by comparing the result.

\item Why do we want to extract the code
  \item Is it even feasible
