\paragraph{Implementation of Weakest Liberal Precondition calculus.}
We implemented the rules for weakest liberal precondition by a recursive function that directly
follows the inference rules.
We focus on two of the rules, namely assignments and while statements, which both does substitution in the formula.
For assignments we define the rule as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
| Sass x e -> let y = fresh_from q in
              Fall y (Fimp (Fand (Fterm (Bleq (Avar y) e))
                                 (Fterm (Bleq e (Avar y)))) (subst_fmla q x y))
\end{lstlisting}

We first generate a fresh variable, which is then substituted into the postcondition $Q$.
We further follow the semantics, however since we do not have equality we use $y \leq e \wedge e \leq y$.

The other interesting rule, for while, is implemented as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
| Swhile cond inv body ->
  Fand inv
       (abstract_effects body
       (Fand (Fimp (Fand (Fterm cond) inv) (wp body inv))
             (Fimp (Fand (Fnot (Fterm cond)) inv) q))
       )
\end{lstlisting}

Here the interesting thing is the function \texttt{abstract\_effects}. This function quantifies over all assigned variables in the body of the loop and substitute the quantifiers with the free variables in the formula
$((cond \wedge inv) \Rightarrow wp(body,inv)) \wedge ((\neg cond \wedge inv) \Rightarrow Q)$. like \texttt{fresh\_from} this function is inspired by \cite{TODO}. The story is the same. They used axioms to define the function, whereas we have to implement it.
\texttt{abstract\_effects} takes a statement $s$ and formula $f$.
If the statement is an assignment
a fresh variable is made and substituted into $f$, and we then quantify the freshly made variable.
This is not the most efficient solution, as multiple assignment to the same variable will create unused quantifiers.
All ther cases will traverse the abstract syntaxt tree or is a leaf and does nothing.

\begin{lstlisting}
let rec function abstract_effects (s : stmt int) (f : formula int) : formula int
  variant { s }
= match s with
  | Sskip | Sassert _ -> f
  | Sseq s1 s2 | Sif _ s1 s2 -> abstract_effects s2 (abstract_effects s1 f)
  | Sass x _ -> let v = fresh_from f in
                let f' = subst_fmla f x v in
                Fall v f'
  | Swhile _ _ s -> abstract_effects s f
  end
\end{lstlisting}

Whilst we implemented this function directly, we still want the properties for the function to hold.
Firstly, we have

\begin{lstlisting}
  lemma abstract_effects_specialize : forall st : store int, s f.
    eval_formula (abstract_effects s f) st -> eval_formula f st
\end{lstlisting}

which states that evaluation of applying abstract effects off s on f in state st implies that f evaluates to true in st. Essentially it states that if we quantify the variables in f and the formula is true under the quantification, then $f$ also hold if the variables are not quantified.
THIS DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE??? PLEASE LOOK AT IT TOMORROW.
Secondly, we have
\begin{lstlisting}
lemma abstract_effects_distrib_conj : forall s p q st.
   eval_formula (abstract_effects s p) st /\ eval_formula (abstract_effects s q) st ->
   eval_formula (abstract_effects s (Fand p q)) st
 \end{lstlisting}

Which states that if we apply abstract effects of s on two formulas p and q and they both evaluates to true,
then evaluating the result of applying the abstract effects of s on the conjunction of p and q, must also be true.
Thirdly, we have the property of monotinicity.

\begin{lstlisting}
lemma abstract_effects_monotonic : forall s p q.
   valid_formula (Fimp p q) ->
   forall st. eval_formula (abstract_effects s p) st ->
   eval_formula (abstract_effects s q) st
 \end{lstlisting}

If the formula $p \Rightarrow q$ is valid,



\paragraph{Properties of WLP}
How do we ensure that it is correct? I.e follows the semantics.
