The properties we want to hold for arithmetic expressions are straightforward.
We want our program to be deterministic which means each part of the semantics must be deterministic, i.e. the semantic relation must be functional.
Furthermore we want semantics to be total, such that we never encounter undefined behaviour.
We already presented a formulation for determinism of arithmetic expressions in \autoref{lst:why3fun}.
This lemma cannot be proved directly.
