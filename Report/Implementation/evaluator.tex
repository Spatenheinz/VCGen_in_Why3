With our formalization of the semantics, we can define an evaluator and must do so if we want an extractable evaluator for WHILE.
We showed earlier how, the total function lemmas got folded out and expressed
the total function satisfying the semantics.
The evaluator essentially implements this approach, although modelling the store as a mapping is not satisfactory.
Firstly, the semantics for statements results in a store under normal evaluation
and for an evaluator which returns a mapping to be useful we want the be able to
reason about the final store.
This can be done by mappings, but requires any post processing to have knowledge
of the variables assigned in the program either by the user or computationally.
An easier approach would be to have a data-structure which stores key value pairs.
We ended up using a mutable list of key value pairs, which has some promises about its state.
