\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future}
Our implementation has been quite incomplete, as we have not been able to verify
large parts of the codebase. So an obvious point for future work would be to complete these proofs,
either by rewriting the formalization in a more suitable way or finishing the proofs in Coq.

Another interesting project extension would be to continue the half finished implementation in Isabelle.
It seems like it would be doable but this still requires some decent understanding of Isabelle,
and code extraction in Isabelle is quite easy, although not necessarily efficient out of the box.

Since the motivation behind the project was with eBPF as an object language in mind, it would be interesting to
extend the language to allow for memory access and other operators such as division, module and bitwise operators.
