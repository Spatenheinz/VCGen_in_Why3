\section{Results}
In this section we go over the results from the project.
We will cover the findings,
what limitations we encountered,
if we succeeded in making a verified Verification Condition Generator in Why3 and if it is even feasible to do so.

\subsection{Overview of Findings from Implementation}
From \ref{sec:implementation} it should be apparent that while


\subsection{limitiations for verification}
What does it take to prove stuff with the two tools.

\subsection{Is it useful?}
NOTE: Determine whether our VC generator is effective in generating VC's for WHILE programs?
What does it mean????
